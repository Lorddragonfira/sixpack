### Research the origins of the KanBan board.   
## What does it mean? 

In Japanese, kanban literally translates to "visual signal." For kanban teams, every work item is represented as a separate card on the board. The main purpose of representing work as a card on the kanban board is to allow team members to track the progress of work through its workflow in a highly visual manner.  
  
## Who invented it? 

T Ohno - The first Kanban system was developed by Taiichi Ohno(Industrial Engineer and Businessman) for Toyota automotive in Japan. It was created as a simple planning system, the aim of which was to control and manage work and inventory at every stage of production optimally. 
 
 ## What was the alternative model in that industry? 
Scrum

## Problem Identification
1. Remote internet speed and equipment 
- People can’t reliably engage/communicate with other recipients without poor connection. 
- Wants/needs: We want to have faster reliable internet.
2.Digital industry conference platforms 
- Current Industry platforms (Microsoft Teams) are laggy, out of date, does not have good UI and is just very complicated and excessive. 
- Wants/Needs: More intuitive interface, accessible and customizable, including add-ons, affordable.
3. Deepfake content 
- People can’t reliably differentiate the differences between a real video and a deep fake video 
- Wants/Needs: We want deepfakes to be transparent and have a blockchain like ownership attached to them, limitations for the use of content or copyright.
4. Privacy policies 
- Large corporations are currrently finding loopholes or completely ignoring the privacy policies.
- Wants/Needs: We want to be able to hold corporations accountable for their breach of privacy policies
5. Mobile payments
- Currently unreliable and secruity risks associated with Mobile Payments, along with no real incentives. 
- Wants/Needs: We need reliable and trustworthy mobile payment options along with great incentives e.g reward point system.
6. Everyday companion app
- The apps and software are still not intuitive or very affordable. There is also a lack of range of actual helpful and useful apps and software available in the current market that just gets the job we need done properly and efficiently (E.g all in one language translating/teaching app). 
- Wants/Needs: We want to have access to a wider variety of apps and software that are efficient at doing what is needed "e.g teaching/translating languages" and is affordable and intuitive to use for the wider public
7. Gaps between health and tech 
- Although it is getting better there is still a gap between technology and health. Still too many health problems that cannot be solved through technology. For example they don't have enough viable products to help with cot death and its not secure enough to be trustworthy for parents to use/buy 
- Wants/Needs: We want to have trustworthy, secure and efficient technology that will better our health and be able to monitor our day to day health routines better and more efficiently.
8. Lacking Home app software 
- We can't use just one app/software that is compatible between all hubs e.g Brands are only limited to interacting with the same brands. 
- Wants/Needs: We want to be able to just use one app/software that can communicate between all our devices in our home or between the hubs


## Brainstorm Solutions

Remote internet speed and equipment
- By zipping or compressing files as we send them, 5G, Better video, better cameras for computers. Better internet speeds, more accessible and affordable
- A camera that is detachable and can be attached to any device. It also comes with high quality audio and video capabilities is very affordable to the public.
- An internet provider that solely focuses on laser fast internet speeds for conferences,gaming, etc.


2. Digital Insdustry conference platforms
-  More intuitive interface, accessible and customizable, including add-ons, affordable 
-  An online platform like Twitch, but is an avenue for all means and  purposes not just a singular one. Like a streaming/youtube room thats not restricted to just
   gaming/chatting/working but combines them all. A one stop online streaming platform. 

3. Deepfake content
 - We want deepfakes to be transparent and have a blockchain like ownership attached to them, limitations for the use of content or copyright
 - An app/software/service that is able to differentiate deepfake content from real content
 

4. Privacy policies
 - Encrypt data to ensure moral and ethical use of privacy data is maintained. 
 - A software/app/technology/governing body of people which can monitor private policies and detect breaking of these policies and rules

5. Mobile payments
- A software update and the actual terminal.
- An app/software that is trustworthy, secure, intuitive and efficient on all OS systems. Like Apple pay but not just for the IOS.

6. Everyday companion app
- A language app that is affordable, intuitive and combines all the needs and wants of what you want in a good app. The Facebook or Google of language teaching/translating apps.
        
7. Gaps between health and tech
- A bed that monitors body vitals and is able to attend to patients according to their health needs and wants. E.g move patients on to their side automatically every 30 minutes   whilist having a clear and fully monitored body vitals and signals.

8. Lacking Home app software
- A device that allows for the monitoring of a baby when its asleep but also is able to sooth a baby to sleep when its bed time or if they woke up in the middle of a night.

## Prepare "Prepare Elevator Pitch"
### Internet of Things
IoT is a multitude of physical object with smart software and sensors embedded to collect, analyse and report data through wireless connection. The application of this technology is endless with the projection of a 22 billion growth by 2025. Converging multiple devices to create real-time analytics to solve a problem can be applied to:

1. Healthcare
2. Agriculture
3. Traffic Management
4. Environmental Monitoring
5. Home Automation
... just to name a few.

#### Applications in Healthcare
Problem: with the current decline in health care workers, nurses are over-run with mundane tasks of checking individual patients vitals and physical needs, relaying information to doctors and waiting for a doctors diagnosis for the nurse to implement. Solution:
- [ ] Software installed in a hospital bed to monitor body vitals
- [ ] Data collected on hospital beds to be sent to the appropriate healthcare professional
- [ ] Smart bed to move patient according to requirements

#### Applications in Agriculture
Problem: Labour intensive work in agriculture is inefficient and physically checking crop requirements whether it be pesticide, fertiliser, irrigation can be costly. Solution:
- [ ] Creating a controlled environment subject to crop requirement
- [ ] Automatic irrigation and fertiliser distribition
- [ ] Monitoring crop responses

#### Applications in Traffic Management
Problem: Auckland traffic lights and road maintenance is reliant on individuals reporting through NZTA website and policing. Solution:
- [ ] Changing timed traffic lights / road sensors to a smart traffic light that maximises traffic flow.
- [ ] Allowing emergency vehicles to pass without having to overtake on the wrong side of the road.
- [ ] ID traffic violators
- [ ] Smart vehicles reporting pot holes

#### Applications in Environmental Monitoring
Problem: Environmental degradation and climate change are a massive issue in today's world. Solution:
- [ ] Monitoring and managing air polution
- [ ] Monitoring and managing water quality, levels, chemicals, diseases and overflow
- [ ] Monitoring movements in wildlife and habitats

#### Applications in Home Automation
Problem: Inefficiently run household. Solution to optimise:
- [ ] Monitoring household vitals to call emergency services when required
- [ ] Anti-theft system
- [ ] Fire sensors and exit guide
- [ ] Sensors that can see where you are and turn switches off and on accordingly
- [ ] Smart cradle system for infants

As a group we will mitigate problems in (for example) avoidable infant deaths by creating a software that monitor baby movements in cots during sleep and sending alert signals to parents when required.
