### Research the origins of the KanBan board.   
## What does it mean? 

In Japanese, kanban literally translates to "visual signal." For kanban teams, every work item is represented as a separate card on the board. The main purpose of representing work as a card on the kanban board is to allow team members to track the progress of work through its workflow in a highly visual manner.  
  
## Who invented it? 

T Ohno - The first Kanban system was developed by Taiichi Ohno(Industrial Engineer and Businessman) for Toyota automotive in Japan. It was created as a simple planning system, the aim of which was to control and manage work and inventory at every stage of production optimally. 
 
 ## What was the alternative model in that industry?

## Prepare "Prepare Elevator Pitch"
### Internet of Things
IoT is a multitude of physical object with smart software and sensors embedded to collect, analyse and report data through wireless connection. The application of this technology is endless with the projection of a 22 billion growth by 2025. Converging multiple devices to create real-time analytics to solve a problem can be applied to:

1. Healthcare
2. Agriculture
3. Traffic Management
4. Environmental Monitoring
5. Home Automation
... just to name a few.

#### Applications in Healthcare
Problem: with the current decline in health care workers, nurses are over-run with mundane tasks of checking individual patients vitals and physical needs, relaying information to doctors and waiting for a doctors diagnosis for the nurse to implement. Solution:
- [ ] Software installed in a hospital bed to monitor body vitals
- [ ] Data collected on hospital beds to be sent to the appropriate healthcare professional
- [ ] Smart bed to move patient according to requirements

#### Applications in Agriculture
Problem: Labour intensive work in agriculture is inefficient and physically checking crop requirements whether it be pesticide, fertiliser, irrigation can be costly. Solution:
- [ ] Creating a controlled environment subject to crop requirement
- [ ] Automatic irrigation and fertiliser distribition
- [ ] Monitoring crop responses

#### Applications in Traffic Management
Problem: Auckland traffic lights and road maintenance is reliant on individuals reporting through NZTA website and policing. Solution:
- [ ] Changing timed traffic lights / road sensors to a smart traffic light that maximises traffic flow.
- [ ] Allowing emergency vehicles to pass without having to overtake on the wrong side of the road.
- [ ] ID traffic violators
- [ ] Smart vehicles reporting pot holes

#### Applications in Environmental Monitoring
Problem: Environmental degradation and climate change are a massive issue in today's world. Solution:
- [ ] Monitoring and managing air polution
- [ ] Monitoring and managing water quality, levels, chemicals, diseases and overflow
- [ ] Monitoring movements in wildlife and habitats

#### Applications in Home Automation
Problem: Inefficiently run household. Solution to optimise:
- [ ] Monitoring household vitals to call emergency services when required
- [ ] Anti-theft system
- [ ] Fire sensors and exit guide
- [ ] Sensors that can see where you are and turn switches off and on accordingly
- [ ] Smart cradle system for infants

As a group we will mitigate problems in (for example) avoidable infant deaths by creating a software that monitor baby movements in cots during sleep and sending alert signals to parents when required.
